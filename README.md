# universality

Does Feigenbaum universality apply to LLM feedback loops? The founding document is
[PROJECT.md](PROJECT.md); this file is how to run the code.

## Setup

Everything runs with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

    uv run uni gen "hello"

That one command installs everything and generates from the pinned model. The first run
downloads the checkpoint, about a gigabyte, into the Hugging Face cache. It prints the
text, its sha256, and each generated token with its log-probability.

The model, its revision, dtype, and generation limit are pinned in
[uni/pinned.toml](uni/pinned.toml), and nothing else in the code names them. Generation
runs on Metal, greedy at batch size one; the checkpoint's own sampling settings are
ignored. CPU is too slow for this work, so it is not an option.

## Determinism

Every measurement in this project compares hashes of generated text, so the same input
must produce the same output every time. The gate checks that:

    uv run uni determinism --remote

It generates each case 100 times and prints every run's sha256, then a verdict per
case. It exits 1 if any case produced more than one hash. The cases are an ordinary
prompt, the empty prompt, and a prompt that fills the model's context limit with 16
tokens left over. `--runs` changes the count. A full run takes about 15 minutes, and
it has passed on the run host. Run it again when the model, torch, transformers, or
macOS on the run host changes; nothing else can change the result.

`uv run pytest` checks the same cases with 3 runs each, so the suite stays fast, and
also checks that a fresh process produces the same hash, since the command's runs all
share one process.

Hashes are only comparable within one machine. The run host and a dev Mac agree on
tokens and hashes but differ in the sixth decimal of the log-probabilities.

`tests/test_determinism.py` also holds a negative test, which shows the failure the
gate protects against. The same prompt, batched with a longer request and left-padded
with positions counted from the mask, gives log-probabilities that differ from batch
size one by up to about 1e-4. The greedy text survives that on a short prompt, but in
a long feedback loop a near-tie flips a token, and one flipped token turns an orbit
into noise. That is why the wrapper generates at batch size one and has no batch
setting.

## The loop

A template turns a state into a prompt, and the model's reply is the next state. Feeding
the reply back in, step after step, makes the model an iterated map:

    uv run uni loop --template rewrite --steps 20 --start "The lighthouse keeper climbed the stairs."

It prints the start as step 0 and every state after it, one per line, then writes the
trajectory to `trajectories/<name>.json` and prints the path. The file holds the start,
every state, the knob value, the template's text, and the pinned config, so the run can
be reproduced from the file alone. The name is a hash of those inputs and the step
count. Rerunning the same command rewrites the same file with the same bytes. With
`--remote` the file is written on the run host. The sync neither sends nor deletes
`trajectories/`, so each machine keeps its own. The directory is also gitignored.

The templates live in [uni/templates.toml](uni/templates.toml), each holding `{state}`
exactly once. `identity` asks for the state back unchanged, `empty` sends the state as
the whole prompt, and `rewrite` asks for a rewrite. The start may be empty.

## The steering knob

A knob is a number turned on the loop. The first one steers the model: it adds the
value times a fixed direction to the residual stream leaving one decoder layer, at every
position of every step.

    uv run uni loop --template rewrite --steps 20 --start "..." --knob formality --value 2

`--knob` names a direction in [uni/directions](uni/directions), or `none`, the default.
`--value` defaults to 0, and at 0 the orbit is exactly the unsteered one. Positive values
push the rewrites toward the direction's quality and negative values push away from it.
At layer 12, `formality` makes the rewrites clearly more formal by 2 and casual by -2. By
4 the rewrites drift away from the text they started from. Any value runs without error, however large.

A direction comes from a contrast, `uni/directions/<name>.toml`. A contrast is a
template, a layer, and pairs of replies to the same text, one toward the quality and
one away from it. Each reply is read as the model's own answer to the template, and the
direction is the mean over pairs of the difference in the layer's residual stream,
averaged over the reply's tokens. Derive it once:

    uv run uni direction formality

This writes `uni/directions/formality.json`, which holds the vector, a copy of the
contrast that produced it, and the pinned model it was read from, and is committed. Every
trajectory steered by it records the direction's name, layer, and sha256. A direction
derived on a different model than the one pinned is refused. Re-derive when the contrast
or the model changes.

## Running on the experiment host

Every `uni` command accepts `--remote`. With it, this working tree, uncommitted edits
included, is mirrored to a host with rsync and the same command runs there over ssh,
streaming its output back. Without it, the command runs here.

The host is described only by three variables, read from a gitignored `.env` at the
repo root. Copy the example and fill it in:

    cp .env.example .env

| Variable          | Meaning                                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `UNI_REMOTE_HOST` | Hostname or ssh config alias of the host             |
| `UNI_REMOTE_USER` | The user to ssh as                                   |
| `UNI_REMOTE_DIR`  | Absolute path on the host to mirror the tree into, plain characters only |

A real environment variable overrides the file. Run `--remote` from inside the checkout;
the tree that is mirrored is the one git sees from where you stand. The host needs key-based ssh access,
`rsync`, and `uv` on the PATH that a non-interactive ssh command sees.

    uv run uni host --remote

The repo is public. No hostname, user, or ssh target belongs in the tracked tree.
`tests/test_no_identity.py` fails the suite if a tracked file contains an ssh target, a
`.local` name, a private IPv4 address, or any value from your own `.env`. That last
check is the one that knows your host; run the suite with your `.env` in place.

## Tests

    uv run pytest
