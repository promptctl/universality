# universality

Does Feigenbaum universality apply to LLM feedback loops? The founding document is
[PROJECT.md](PROJECT.md); this file is how to run the code.

## Setup

Everything runs with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

    uv sync
    uv run uni host

## Running on the experiment host

Every `uni` command accepts `--remote`. With it, this working tree, uncommitted edits
included, is mirrored to a host with rsync and the same command runs there over ssh,
streaming its output back. Without it, the command runs here.

The host is described only by three variables, read from a gitignored `.env` at the
repo root. Copy the example and fill it in:

    cp .env.example .env

| Variable          | Meaning                                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `UNI_REMOTE_HOST` | Hostname or ssh config alias of the host             |
| `UNI_REMOTE_USER` | The user to ssh as                                   |
| `UNI_REMOTE_DIR`  | Absolute path on the host to mirror the tree into, plain characters only |

A real environment variable overrides the file. Run `--remote` from inside the checkout;
the tree that is mirrored is the one git sees from where you stand. The host needs key-based ssh access,
`rsync`, and `uv` on the PATH that a non-interactive ssh command sees.

    uv run uni host --remote

The repo is public. No hostname, user, or ssh target belongs in the tracked tree.
`tests/test_no_identity.py` fails the suite if a tracked file contains an ssh target, a
`.local` name, a private IPv4 address, or any value from your own `.env`. That last
check is the one that knows your host; run the suite with your `.env` in place.

## Tests

    uv run pytest
